# Backtracking

## Overview
Depth-first search over decision trees with undo steps.

## Pattern signals
- Need all valid combinations
- Choices can be explored recursively
- Pruning can reduce search space

## Complexity habits
- Start with a brute-force baseline and write down its complexity.
- Target O(n) or O(n log n) when possible.
- Note extra memory trade-offs clearly in the solution docstring.

## Starter problems
- [x] Subsets
- [ ] Permutations
- [ ] Combination Sum

## How to add a problem in this folder
1. Run: python scripts/create_problem.py --pattern backtracking --problem your_problem_name
2. Implement `class Solution` method(s) in the generated module.
3. Replace the placeholder test with real test cases.
4. Run python -m pytest from repository root.
