# Intervals

## Overview
Sort and merge ranges while tracking overlap rules.

## Pattern signals
- Need merge or insert operations
- Need overlap detection
- Need sweep-line style processing

## Complexity habits
- Start with a brute-force baseline and write down its complexity.
- Target O(n) or O(n log n) when possible.
- Note extra memory trade-offs clearly in the solution docstring.

## Starter problems
- [x] Merge Intervals
- [ ] Insert Interval
- [ ] Non-overlapping Intervals

## How to add a problem in this folder
1. Run: python scripts/create_problem.py --pattern intervals --problem your_problem_name
2. Implement `class Solution` method(s) in the generated module.
3. Replace the placeholder test with real test cases.
4. Run python -m pytest from repository root.
